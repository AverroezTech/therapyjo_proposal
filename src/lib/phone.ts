 * Jordanian phone numbers get typed in a dozen shapes depending on who is
 * entering them and what they copy from — a WhatsApp contact card, a paper
 * intake form, a number read aloud over the phone. "0790022404",
 * "+962 7 9101 0021", "962790022404" and "790022404" are frequently the
 * SAME number. Comparing the raw strings (what the old duplicate-detection
 * code did) misses nearly all of that, because none of those strings are
 * equal to each other even though a human reads them as the same digits.
 *
 * normalizePhone() collapses all of these into one canonical key so two
 * differently-typed copies of the same number compare equal. It intentionally
 * throws away everything that isn't information about WHICH number this is
 * (formatting, the country code when it's the local default, the domestic
 * trunk zero) and keeps only the digits that actually distinguish one
 * subscriber from another.

// (7-prefixed 9-digit mobiles, 6-prefixed 8-digit landlines), is what lets
// "0790022404", "+962790022404" and "790022404" all collapse to "790022404".

 * short to mean anything: fewer than 6 digits comes back as "", and callers
